# Three.js Project: Realistic Rendering

A simple Three.js app that showcases a teapot model rendered with physically based (PBR) materials and an HDR environment. The scene includes orbit controls, and real-time reflections and refractions.

## Features

- **HDR Environment**: Utilizes an HDR texture to create realistic reflections and lighting.
- **Physically Based Material**: The model uses a `MeshPhysicalMaterial` for realistic rendering.
- **Teapot Geometry**: Displays a teapot model using `TeapotGeometry`.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adjusts the canvas when the window is resized.


### Installation
